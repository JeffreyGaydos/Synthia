# Synthia
Oh boy let's see if I can make my "own" NLP model. Not to be confused with `SYNTHIA`, a trademark of Millipore Sigma.

Named `Synthia` because of my focus on music-based commands such as:
- Next
- Previous
- Play
- Pause
- Volume
- Up
- Down
- Shuffle
- On
- Off
- Cancel

Let's start with just those for now.
